The notebooks in this repo are single-purpose and approachable. If you haven't used Python Notebooks before, start with im-new-here.

## 0-im-new-here

Python environment setup, installing dependencies, API keys, .env files

## 1-llm-calls

### 1: Titan Submarine Investigation

The United States National Trasportation Safety Board conducted a multi year investigation into the Titan Submarine implosion. The findings are detailed in a 79 page PDF. We extract the data, embed it, then get to do our own investigation!

March 2021: Congress summoned Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pachai to investigate their respective platform's involvment in the polarization of the United States over the previous years. In just a few minutes we will take this 244 page transcript and make it into a knowledgebase we can use to see how these guys were defending their decisions!

### 3: Wikipedia trends

We see how we can summarize and make sense of wikipedia trending data found within CSVs I created through my [Wikipedia Chronicle](https://wiki-chronicle.lovable.app/) project
